Hi! I am Sydney Pugh, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Artificial Intelligence for Ambulatory Care Innovation (AI-4-AI) Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/kbjohnsonlab/) at the [Univeristy of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), where I am advised by [Kevin Johnson](https://www.kevinbjohnsonmd.net/). My research interests are in developing safe and effective medical AI systems, with emphasis on techniques to address challenges associated with real-world medical data constraints (e.g., small data, lack of ground-truth). Currently, I am working on developing a real-time multimodal AI system for early detection of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's dementia.

I earned my Ph.D. in [Computer and Information Science (CIS)](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania in August 2024, where I was advised by [Insup Lee](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/home/index.shtml) and [James Weimer](https://jamesweimer.net/). My [disseration](https://www.proquest.com/openview/d1142238baa72023e1668a6caf01e8a7/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) explored weakly-supervised methods for rapid and cost-effective performance evaluation of medical AI systems. I also earned my M.S.E. in CIS at UPenn in 2021. Prior to that, I earned my B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from [Loyola University Maryland](https://www.loyola.edu/) in 2019.
